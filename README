=Blog

A simple RESTful rails blog using common plugins, heavily tested with RSpec.  The project has been built in stages and tagged at each.  Attempts have been made to achieve 100% code coverage through RSpec. The blog follows normal blogging conventions and sticks to the basics, pure and simple.  The project is intended to form the starting point for any Rails application requiring a blog.  It may be modified in the future to be distributed as a plugin.
